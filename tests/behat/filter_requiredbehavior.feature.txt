#  @javascript
#  Scenario: Check if the required field works
#    Given I log in as "teacher1"
#    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
#    And I follow "Datalynx Test Instance"
#    And I follow "Manage"
#    And I follow "Views"
#    And I click "Edit" button of "testview" item
#    And I follow "Entry template"
#    And I click inside "id_eparam2_editoreditable"
#    And I set the field "eparam2_editor_field_tag_menu" to ""
#    And I press "Save changes"
#    And I follow "Browse"
#    And I follow "Add a new entry"
#    Then I should see "New entry"
#    And I should see "testfield"
#    Then I press "Save changes"
#    But I should not see "ntry(s) updated"
#    And I should see "must supply a value here"
