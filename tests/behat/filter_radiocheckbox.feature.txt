#  Scenario: Check if filter works for radiobuttons
#    Given I log in as "teacher1"
#    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
#    And I follow "Datalynx Test Instance"
#    Then I set the field "view" to "RadioView"
#    And I should see "radioB"
#    And I should see "bothBB"
#    And I should see "bothAB"
#    But I should not see "checkA"
#    But I should not see "checkB"
#    But I should not see "nonono"
#    But I should not see "radioA"
#    But I should not see "bothAA"
#    But I should not see "bothBA"
#    Then I set the field "view" to "CheckView"
#    And I should see "checkB"
#    And I should see "bothBB"
#    And I should see "bothBA"
#    But I should not see "nonono"
#    But I should not see "radioA"
