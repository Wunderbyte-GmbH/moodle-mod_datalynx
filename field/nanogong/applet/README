Thank you for downloading the NanoGong applet!

Use the NanoGong Applet
-----------------------

NanoGong is a 'simple' Java applet which you can put in any web page. We have
included an example index.html at the root directory so that you can quickly
make a web page with NanoGong by modifying the given page.

Here are the brief steps to create your NanoGong page:

1) Modify the index.html with appropriate content, you may change the filename
   as well if you want to
2) Copy both index.html and nanogong.jar to the location where you usually put
   your web pages in
3) Open a browser and type in the location of the index.html you have just
   uploaded

Done! In just 3 steps you will have a NanoGong page ready on the Web.

Build the NanoGong Applet
-------------------------

This package contains the necessary source code for creating your own version of
NanoGong applet. The JSpeex library is provided in binary form inside the jspeex
directory. The build file, build.xml, at the root directory can be used to
compile the source code as well as pack the resulting class files together with
the JSpeex library in a Jar file.

To sign the Jar file, which is necessary for the proper execution of the
NanoGong applet, you can either provide a keystore file called 'keystore.jks',
or sign the Jar file manually. Please refer to the build file for details.
